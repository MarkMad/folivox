"""Automatic markup with a text LLM: a character bible (who is in the book) and per-paragraph speaker marking.

Two passes, both resumable and cached:

1. **Analyse** reads the whole book once, window by window, and builds the *character bible*: names with
   aliases, gender, role, age, speech traits, relations and how many lines each speaks. The bible tells how many
   distinct voices the book needs, before any voice is chosen.
2. **Annotate** walks the paragraphs that contain speech and asks the model to mark who speaks each part (and,
   if asked, where an expression tag belongs). The model sees the bible entries relevant to the window and a short
   context of the previous paragraphs, so "he said" and pronouns resolve across chapters; it may add or correct
   bible entries as it reads.

The model only *annotates*. It is asked to repeat each paragraph with ``<|speaker:N|>`` / ``[tag]`` inserted; the
reply is accepted only if removing the annotations gives exactly the book's paragraph
(:func:`folivox.markup.parse_block`). Anything else, an unknown speaker or tag, a failed call: the narrator reads
that paragraph and a warning is counted. Offsets are always computed here, never taken from the model.
