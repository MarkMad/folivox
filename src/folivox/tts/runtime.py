"""Which inference runtime reads the book: PyTorch (default) or the native C++ one (audio.cpp).

One general switch (``--runtime``, ``FOLIVOX_RUNTIME``, ``[runtime] inference`` in config.toml, the studio's Advanced
settings). Only engines that have a native implementation (CosyVoice 3) are affected; the others ignore it.
``auto`` picks native only on platforms where the Folivox catalog records it as checked (``auto_ok``) and only when it
is installed; everything else stays on PyTorch. Light module: no torch import.
